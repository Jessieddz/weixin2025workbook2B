    <p>I spent the first three weeks trying to create a furry animal themed website, but my webpage seemed to lack creativity, for example, the description of the activity page was always monotonous. In the fourth week, I was accidentally influenced by Kusama's work, and I thought about how to add flowers as a theme to my webpage. In exactly the next two weeks, I learned how to design various types of images in Java script. I suddenly realized that if I included the rest of the week as a module, the content would be unevenly distributed, so I abandoned this layout for now. In my newly designed home page, I added fixed link flowers, and mouse click generated flowers, including four content modules. This seems to set me up to focus on adding side-scrolling pages to my website.<br>During my development, the screen of the web page would occasionally enlarge and the coordinates of my elements would be messed up, although I eventually corrected it, which made me wonder if it would be messed up on someone else's browser, at least my browser was fine.<br> In addition, according to my tutor's advice, I put the back button in the general css to ensure that the coordinates of the button will not be confused in each web page.<br>But I think it makes sense to keep the discrete but related modules of a web page, like my creative code page, because it helps me to add a lot of elements without being cramped and rigid.</p>
